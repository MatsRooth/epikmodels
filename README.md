# epikmodels
Epik is a language for defining computable multi-agent Kripke frames based on
Kleene Algebra with tests, construction of worlds as guarded strings in a guarded string model for KAT,
and epistemic modeling using event alternatives as in dynamic epistemic logic. 
See https://github.com/ericthewry/epik.

This repository contains Epik example models, Haskell code for translating Epik programs to Fst,
and the embedding of KAT in Fst.

Languages: Haskell, Fst (xfst/foma).
